# Comparing Percentage of Adult Obesity by State

## About
This is a repository created for Professor Gotzler's ENGL 105 class in Fall 2022 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 

The repository contains an original data set, a final data subset (located in the "Data" folder) and a Python notebook (titled "Data Compilation Process") that documents the process of creating your own data subset from a publicly available dataset using Python.

## Acknowledgments
The tutorials from the Data Compilation notebook have been adapted from materials provided by the excellent staff at the Davis Library Research Hub.

This original data set, the County Health Data, provides a variety of data on health-related issues, such as the number of premature death, teen births, primary care physicians, violent crimes, and injury deaths, in all states, regions, and counties in 2014. 

## Purpose and Possible Data Usage
According to CDC, adults with obesity are at increased risk for many other serious health conditions such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, and poor mental health, and many report being stigmatized because of their weight. 

The data subset is filtered from the County Health Data set to raise awareness about adult obesity and allow people to compare the percentage of adult obesity by state in 2014. It also illustrates the urgent need for making obesity prevention and treatment accessible to all Americans in every state and every community as central states tend to have a higher percentage of adult obesity than other states. 

While treatment options for obesity exist, there is inequitable access to those in the United States. This data could be useful for policymakers and the government, serving as a guide to address inequitable access to obesity treatment seen in certain areas and states.

## Data Visualization
In this visualization, each state is colored according to the range of percentage people with obesity, from less than 0.26 to more than 0.4. 

As shown in the visual, states with the highest percentages of adult obesity are concentrated in the central of the United States, compared to surrounding states, whose percentages are less than 0.31.
